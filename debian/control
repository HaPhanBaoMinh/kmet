Description: a lightweight kubectl top alternative with TUI for Kubernetes metrics
 kmet is a command-line tool written in Go that provides a top-like
 interface for Kubernetes clusters. It uses client-go and the metrics
 API to show real-time CPU and memory usage of Pods and Nodes.
 The interface is built with Bubbletea to resemble a simplified K9s,
 featuring tables, navigation, sorting, and log streaming.
 .
 Features:
  - top pods / top nodes view with CPU and memory usage
  - namespace and label selector support
  - sort by CPU or memory
  - live watch/refresh mode
  - interactive TUI with bars, sparklines, and info pane
  - view container logs directly from the UI
